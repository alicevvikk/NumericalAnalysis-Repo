		Naive Gaussian Elimination
	
			-- Based on elementary row operations Ax=B => Ux = B
				-- U is upper triangular matrix
			-- Two steps
				1- Forward Elimination
					-- Is the process to get Upper triangular matrix by applying
						elementary row operations
				2- Back Substituion
					-- Gives us the solution in reverse order

"""

		LU Decomposition
			-- LU Decomposition is another method to solve a set of simultaneous linear
				equations.


			-- A = LU
			--[U] is the same as the coefficient matrix at the end of the forward
				elimination step. Upper Triangular Matrix
					[u11 u12 u13
					 0   u22 u23
					 0   0   u33]
				
			--[L] is obtained using the multipliers that were used in the forward 
				elimination process. Lower Triangular Matrix
